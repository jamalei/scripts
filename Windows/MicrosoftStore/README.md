# README - Install Microsoft Store App via PowerShell Script

![Title Banner](/Windows/MicrosoftStore/media/ms_store.png)

### PURPOSE:
I created this script to help install the Microsoft Store App to computers where user accounts failed to create it automatically upon account login. These user accounts were known to use a "roaming" profile where their account folders were from a central storage repository.
