# README - Collection of Active Directory Scripts using PowerShell

![Title Banner](/Windows/ActiveDirectory/media/windows_ad.jpg)

### PURPOSE:
I created these scripts to specifically update a specific user object's field property for an entire domain with hundreds of users. The company I worked for needed the User's "comment" field box be updated with their company's Employee ID number. To manually do this update for each user in the UI would be time consuming and will be prone to user error. These scripts were used as my business solution to this problem.
